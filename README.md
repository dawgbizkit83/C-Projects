# CplusplusProjects

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This application was designed to allow users to see how their investments will grow over time.

#What did you do particularly well?
For this project I believe my coding for the correct formulas was were I did particularly well.

#Where could I enhance my code?
The main enhancement that I could have made during this project would be to work more with the correct spacing.
Depending on the output, the spacing will shift and sometimes not completely align.

#Which pieces of code were most challenging to write?
One challenging piece was the alignment when the output had different number values. I could have spent more time focusing on this and possibly
reaching out to a site like Stack Overflow to reasearch.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects?
I believe that this whole project is useful for other future projects. It worked with some basic code as well as calculations.
Both of these I'm sure will be in future projects as well.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
I believe this program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable based on the location of my code. I feel that may layout and overall construction will
allow me to change formulas quite easily and allow me to reuse this program by simply changing just a few lines of code for a different use.
